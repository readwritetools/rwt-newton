#### Prerequisites

The <span>rwt-snrfilter</span> web component works in any browser that
supports modern W3C standards. Templates are written using <span>BLUE</span><span>
PHRASE</span> notation, which can be compiled into HTML using the free <a href='https://hub.readwritetools.com/desktop/rwview.blue'>Read Write View</a>
desktop app. It has no other prerequisites. Distribution and installation are
done with either NPM or via Github.

#### Installation using NPM

If you are familiar with Node.js and the `package.json` file, you'll be
comfortable installing the component just using this command:

```bash
npm install rwt-snrfilter
```

If you are a front-end Web developer with no prior experience with NPM, follow
these general steps:

   * Install <a href='https://nodejs.org'>Node.js/NPM</a>
on your development computer.
   * Create a `package.json` file in the root of your web project using the command:
```bash
npm init
```

   * Download and install the web component using the command:
```bash
npm install rwt-snrfilter
```


Important note: This web component uses Node.js and NPM and `package.json` as a
convenient *distribution and installation* mechanism. The web component itself
does not need them.

#### Installation using Github

If you are more comfortable using Github for installation, follow these steps:

   * Create a directory `node_modules` in the root of your web project.
   * Clone the <span>rwt-snrfilter</span> web component into it using the
      command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/readwritetools/rwt-snrfilter.git
```


### Using the web component

After installation, you need to add two things to your HTML page to make use of
it.

   * Add a `script` tag to load the component's `rwt-snrfilter.js` file:
```html
<script src='/node_modules/rwt-snrfilter/rwt-snrfilter.js' type=module></script>             
```

   * Add the component tag somewhere on the page, supplying four pieces of slotted
      text:

      1. `span slot=h2` The <h2> heading text (optional).
      2. `span slot=h3` The <h3> heading text (optional).
      3. `span slot=dt` A definition term.
      4. `span slot=dd` A definition description. This typically has an <a> tag with the
         external reference.

Here's an example:

```html
<rwt-snrfilter role=navigation>
    <span slot=h2>Giants</span>
    <span slot=h3>Isaac Newton</span>
    <span slot=dt>Famous quotes</span>
    <span slot=dd><a href='https://example.com/shoulders-of-giants.html'>If I Have Seen Further</a> Using the understanding gained by major thinkers who have gone before in order to make intellectual progress.</span>
</rwt-snrfilter>
```

### Customization

The reference area has limited customization. Supply a background color using
the `background` attribute.

```html
<rwt-snrfilter role=navigation background='#777'>
    ...
</rwt-snrfilter>
```

### Life-cycle events

The component issues life-cycle events.


<dl>
	<dt><code>component-loaded</code></dt>
	<dd>Sent when the component is fully loaded and ready to be used. As a convenience you can use the <code>waitOnLoading()</code> method which returns a promise that resolves when the <code>component-loaded</code> event is received. Call this asynchronously with <code>await</code>.</dd>
</dl>
